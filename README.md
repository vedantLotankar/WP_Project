# 🖐️ Indian Sign Language to Text/Speech Translation  

Welcome to the **Indian Sign Language (ISL) to Text/Speech Translation** project! 🤟 This repository contains an AI-powered system that translates Indian Sign Language into text and speech, making communication more accessible for the deaf and hard-of-hearing community.  

<br/>

## 🎯 Project Overview  

This project aims to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers by leveraging **machine learning** and **computer vision** to recognize hand gestures and convert them into real-time text and speech.  

- **Framework Used:** TensorFlow, MediaPipe 🤖  
- **Model Type:** Deep Learning-based Sign Language Recognition  
- **Dataset:** ISL dataset (videos labeled with corresponding signs)  
- **Goal:** Enable real-time sign-to-text and sign-to-speech conversion  

<br/>

## 🛠️ How It Works  

1. **Hand Tracking:** Utilizes MediaPipe for detecting and tracking hand gestures 🎥  
2. **Sign Recognition:** A machine learning model trained on ISL signs identifies the performed gestures 🧠  
3. **Text & Speech Output:** The recognized sign is converted into text and optionally synthesized into speech 🔊

## 🚀 How to Run  

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vedantLotankar/sign-language-translation.git
   ```  
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  
3. Run the application:  
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## 📈 Future Improvements  

- Expand dataset for improved accuracy 📊  
- Implement multi-hand gesture recognition ✋✋  
- Develop a mobile-friendly version 📱  
- Integrate with video calling platforms like Google Meet & Zoom 🎥
